# henrys_game
My son noticed I was making a text based game as part of working my
way through Ruby The Hard Way and mapped me out a game to code. So
I did. Any suggestions for improvement are welcomed.

Built on OSX with Ruby version 2.0.0p645
Untested on any other Ruby version as of 2/23/16

Run from command line as follows:
	ruby ex36homework_game.rb seed.txt
